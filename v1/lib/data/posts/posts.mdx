##### **What is Next JS?**

Having its fist release in 2016, Next JS has now become a widely used framework in the web development community. But, in a short, what is Next JS? **It is a React framework that allows developers to build single-page JavaScript web apps.**

Next JS, developed by Vercel, is intended to handle all of the tools and customizations that developers may require for React. Furthermore, developers may use the framework to create apps that leverage server-side rendering.

It is tough to compare the two --- Next JS versus React --- since Next JS is a React framework while React is a library. That being stated, we believe that a detailed analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of both of these technologies will be most effective. Let's get started!

##### **Advantages**

###### **SEO-Friendly**

Today, React can be SEO-friendly, but what about Next JS? It's even friendlier now! When a user clicks on a different page in React, it gets mounted independently in the browser. And it all takes place on the client side. Unfortunately, this results in web crawlers being unable to properly index the page.

With Next JS, the situation is different. Because of server-side rendering, apps created with the framework may be indexed more effectively, resulting in higher **SERP visibility (Search Engine Results Page).**

###### **Performance**

Apps developed with Next JS are quick and efficient, owing to static generation, code splitting, and server-side rendering. Moreover, the framework received an **image optimization** capability with the Next 10 release, which improved the efficiency of a web app.

###### **Easy Learning Curve**

When we compare the complexity of React and Next, we can see that the latter is simpler, at least in terms of coding. It has fewer code and is simpler to implement (once the page is done, you have to link it to the component in the header).

###### **Reduced Time-to-Market**

Easier coding, faster development, and superior performance all contribute to a shorter time-to-market rate. In reality, Next JS can be an excellent alternative for creating the MVP.

###### **TypeScript**

Aside from all of the advantages of using Next JS, the framework also supports TypeScript. With a zero-configuration TypeScript setup, developers may create a range of various things, such as **APIs, Pages, and others.**

##### **Disadvantages**

###### **Lack of Knowledge**

We have bad news for individuals who got their hopes up after reading all of the benefits listed above. Next JS is React's framework, therefore in order to use it, you must first grasp React, or at least its basics. Without previous knowledge of the basics, you risk being trapped in development.

###### **Routing**

Another apparent downside of Next is routing. The framework has a file-based router and only partially supports dynamic routing, resulting in a more involved configuration that may not be sufficient for some projects. Of course, dynamic routing is feasible, but you'll need assistance from a third party, such as the NodeJS server.

###### **Small Community**

In comparison to React, Next has a smaller community. That does not, however, prevent you from using the framework! In fact, is smaller than React, but it is steadily increasing day by day. After all, the greater the number of people who use the framework, the easier it is to discover solutions to your burning questions.

##### **What is React?**

React is widely recognized as the most popular JavaScript framework on the market (almost 40% of Stack Overflow respondents admitted to using React). To be honest, calling React a framework is a little deceptive. It is, in fact, **an open-source JavaScript library rather than a framework**. But, hey, we're not here to change the perception!

_So, how did React come about?_

Jordan Walke created React in 2011, but it wasn't available to the public until 2013. Since then, the library's popularity has grown. After all, it's the library of choice for almost 10 million people! As you can see, the numbers speak for themselves. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, React is still developed by engineers at Meta (Facebook).

The reason for this is because React allows developers to create a wide range of various things, such as single-page applications, interactive user interfaces, web apps, and more. The package also contains capabilities like virtual DOM and JSX. Moreover, the most popular React apps are Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Netflix.

##### **Advantages**

###### **Easy to Learn**

Yes, we stated a similar statement in the Next JS benefits, but does that imply we can't include it here? Definitely not. React, like Next JS, has a low learning curve as compared to other libraries or frameworks. Many worldwide firms, like Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, and many more, use the library because of its reusable components, relatively simple learning process, and adaptability.

###### **One-Way Data Flow**

In contrast to most other frameworks, React has a one-way data flow rather than a two-way data flow. But what exactly does it mean? One-way data flow essentially means that it does not need to be updated every time a change is made (just like it is with two-way data flow). Because of this, modifications to specific parts do not affect the overall structure of the program, i.e., changes in child components do not affect parent data.

###### **Community**

When compared to React, the Next JS community was at a minor disadvantage, but what about the library? It's certainly an advantage! There are so many articles, web development blogs, YouTube videos, tutorials, and other publications based on React that you shouldn't get confused or stuck when developing. That is for sure a significant user community!

###### **Reusable Components**

Without reusable components, React would most likely not be as popular as it is today. They are one of the aspects that contribute to the overall ease and smoothness of the development process. Reusable components are essentially "pieces" of code that developers may reuse in other portions of the program or even in future projects without having to write the code from scratch.

###### **Virtual DOM**

Without the Virtual DOM, there would be no React (or at least it would not be as popular as it is now) (Document Object Model). Because it is in charge of React's speed and performance, developers may use it to create quick apps that meet current requirements.

But what exactly is Virtual DOM? It is a virtual representation of the document object model, and the DOM is a tree structure of XML or HTML content. It enables developers to update even the smallest components of a program without fear of affecting the entire project.

###### **React Developer Tools**

Fortunately, while lacking all of the necessary tools, React is supported by the React Developer Tools. It's a browser extension that works with popular browsers including Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. And don't worry about them being out of date! **Over 3 million developers use** them, and they are regularly updated to match modern demands!

###### **Create React App**

The Create React App functionality is another factor influencing React's popularity. It's a Facebook product designed to assist users in creating React applications, as the name implies. It has features like quick reload, just one dependency, and many more! Furthermore, Create React App is simple to maintain, making it a highly appealing option.

###### **Redux**

Redux is a JavaScript library that is frequently used in conjunction with other libraries or frameworks (in this case, React). Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark published it in 2015. Developers may use the library to manage application state and design user interfaces. Using Redux may have a major impact on your development process. State management patterns, for example, speedier development, greater stability, or the capacity to run in a variety of contexts. To use Redux with React, obtain the React Redux tool, which allows the binding of both of these frameworks.

##### **Disadvantages**

###### **JSX**

JSX is a JavaScript extension that is responsible for making the code more legible and cleaner. So, what's the catch? That's because it combines JavaScript and HTML, resulting in a higher learning curve that some developers may not want. There is, however, some good news. Because JSX is optional, you won't have to bother about it if you're not interested in it.

**High Number of Updates and Lack of Documentation**

There just isn't enough time to produce appropriate documentation due to the large amount of changes. Unfortunately, this forces developers to choose between providing their own documentation and accessing documentation supplied by other users.

The latter alternative may appear to be the best option, right? After all, you are not required to provide your own documentation. But is it truly that good? Trusting other developers' comments may be efficient, but you may also come across sparse written tutorials that are either inaccurate or incomplete.

The frequency of updates, on the other hand, is certainly a good thing. However, some React developers may become annoyed when they have to relearn React or at least some of its components with each upgrade. Well, I suppose most of us can identify with such scenarios.

###### **View Layer**

React only works with the view layer of the MVC model (Model-View-Controller) of web and mobile apps, which may come as a surprise. Developers must rely on other tools to complete the application.

##### **Next JS vs React: When to Use Them?**

A straight comparison of Next JS versus React would be misleading because Next is developed on top of React and so is not its competition. That's why --- as you can see above --- we decided to highlight their benefits and downsides. Now consider when developers should use them.

###### **Next JS**

If you're still unsure about when you should use Next JS, we're here to help. That being said, let's go over the scenarios in which you should employ the framework.

- If you intend to build a web application using server-side rendering
- If you're already familiar with React but want to expand your capabilities
- Whenever you intend to create a static website
- Finally, Next JS should be your go-to framework if you want to construct an MVP and shorten time-to-market

###### **React**

Now that we know when to use Next JS, let's consider a development project where React would be the best solution.

- If you wish to create a React project, such as user interfaces, single-page apps, web apps, and so on
- If you want to be a part of React's vibrant and active community, here is the place to be
- If you already know JSX or are interested in learning how it works
- If you intend to build more than one app and reuse the components
